# umich-py3-final

To complete the University of Michigan School of Information specialization [Python 3 Programming](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-3-programming) (hosted by Coursera), students must develop a program as outlined [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-project/peer/TNSAI/project/review/2J0URsWTEey4cBJFWJg6JQ). The project utilized pillow, (py)tesseract, and opencv to process image files archived in a zip file. 

I developed this code in a Jupyter Notebook, with help from Python and libraries' documentations. 

I'd love to hear any feedback!
